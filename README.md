# Project 1 - HTML Portfolio

## Project Overview
This project consists of creating three HTML pages, each containing one desktop-sized, page-scroll worth of content. One page is my professional resume, while the other two pages explore themes of my choice. The project focuses on pure HTML coding, without any CSS or external frameworks, emphasizing semantic structure and proper HTML validation.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Three HTML pages with meaningful content
- [ ] Professional resume as one of the pages
- [ ] Three screen capture images showing successful HTML validation (one per page)
- [ ] GitHub repository containing all project files with at least 10 meaningful commits
- [ ] Live GitHub Pages link to `index.html`

## Requirements
- [ ] No CSS: HTML only, no inline styles, spacing, centering, colors, italics, `<br>` tags, or tables for layout
- [ ] Two spaces per child element for indentation
- [ ] Bulleted list at the top of each page linking to all three pages
- [ ] Include at least three images and one other media type (audio or video)
- [ ] Use relative links for internal files (e.g., `images/picture.jpg`), not full URLs
- [ ] Each HTML page must pass W3C validation
- [ ] Minimum 10 commits in GitHub with meaningful messages
- [ ] Repository contains only files and commits relevant to this project; each website should have its own repository
