  <h1>My Dogs</h1>
  <p>I have two wonderful dogs who are an important part of my life. Their names are Brock and Winston. They are both sweet and dumb at the same time.</p>
  <p>Brock is a large Rottweiler that we found as a stray, dumped on the side of the road in July of 2024. He is very protective of his family, but loves treats and pettings</p>
  <p>Winston is a large Rhodesian Ridgeback who has one mode (full energy) and loves to run and play, but has to be "in charge" at all times.</p>
